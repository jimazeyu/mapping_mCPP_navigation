# mapping-mCPP-navigation
A basic package for 2D SLAM, multi-robot path planning and multi-point navigation. 
1. The robots autonomous explore the unknown environment and create a map.
2. The algorithm generate coverage paths for robots on the map.
3. The robots follow the paths and inspection everywhere in the scene.
4. Navigation Points are generated by ![mCPP](https://github.com/jimazeyu/DARP_for_Real_Gridmap/tree/main)
